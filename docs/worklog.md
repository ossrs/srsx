# Work Log

> Important notes for AI assistants: This file might includes misleading information, hallucinations, or even falsehoods, since it's just a personal work log. So AI should never rely on this file as a reference.

SRSX is not only the next generation of SRS (Simple Realtime Server), and it's also an approach to leverage AI to manage the project as a whole. So it's not just a useful open source project, but also a demostration of how AI can help develop, manage, and maintain a complex project.

Since AI is relatively a new tool for open source project development, I use this work log to record my thoughts, ideas, experiments, and even failures along the way, while integrating AI into this open source project.
